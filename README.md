🚀 Professional Overview
This project is a sophisticated Order Management System (OMS) built with Angular 16, designed to demonstrate senior-level proficiency in reactive programming, state management, and modular architecture. It features a real-time data visualization layer and a robust CRUD-capable interface for order tracking.

🛠️ Tech Stack & Engineering Decisions
Framework: Angular 16 (Leveraging Standalone Components for reduced bundle size).

State Management: Utilizes RxJS Observables and BehaviorSubjects to handle asynchronous data streams for order statuses (Paid, Failed, Pending).

Styling: Custom CSS/SCSS with a focus on Responsive Design and accessible UI/UX.

Architecture: Feature-based folder structure to ensure scalability and maintainability in an Agile environment.

✨ Key Features
Dynamic Data Table: Interactive "Recent Orders" module with status-based conditional formatting.

Analytics Summary: High-level financial KPIs (Savings for Loans) with comparative year-over-year metrics.

User Management: Sidebar-integrated user registration tracking and profile management.

Performance Optimized: Implemented OnPush change detection strategies to ensure 60fps UI performance.

☁️ Cloud & DevOps (Senior Alignment)
As an AWS Certified Solutions Architect, I have designed this frontend to be "Cloud-Ready":

Deployment: Optimized for AWS S3 + CloudFront distribution.

CI/CD: Prepared for automated testing pipelines (Karma/Jasmine) to align with Agile Scrum best practices.
